# Pokémon Dashboard Project

What We Learn

Tableau Public: Learning the fundamental skills we need to build creative and interactive
data visualisations

SQL: Demonstrating our knowledge in intermediate SQL queries to thoroughly explore our dataset.

Project Management: Practice using different technologies together as well as planning out the project from start to finish, from collecting data to generate a dataset to using SQL queries to help visualise the data in Tableau.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from https://pokemondb.net, using their 'text list generator' tool which allows us to easily create a csv file as our starting point. The data contains information on various Pokémon, including their names, types, base stats, and other relevant attributes.

Visualizations

In this project, we create five visualizations to utilize in our final resulting dashboard.

1. Pokemon Stats Overview

Description: A bar chart that displays the attributes and stats of every pokemon

2. Pokemon Type Distribution (both single- and dual-types)

A bar chart and a matrix to compare the numbers of both the single- and dual-typed pokemon

3. Stats Trend by Generation

A line graph which displays the trend of increasing stats in each generation of Pokemon

4. Number of Pokemon by Generation

A simple bar chart which shows the number of pokemon in each generation.
